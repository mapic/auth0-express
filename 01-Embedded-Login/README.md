## Running the Sample

Install the dependencies.

```bash
# copy configuration and replace with your own
cp .env.example .env
```

## Enable Cross Origin Authentication

In order to be able to log-in with user and password you need to enable the [Cross Origin Authentication](https://auth0.com/docs/cross-origin-authentication). This is not required for Social or Enterprise connections.

Make sure you edit the contents of the `callback-cross-auth.html` file to match your Client Id, Domain and Callback settings. This page will only be used when third-party cookies are disabled in the client browser, and *needs to be served over HTTPS*. Note that when third-party cookies are disabled, there are some browsers where the authentication flow will NOT work. 


## Run the Application

Run the application by executing the command below.

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be served at `localhost:3000`.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
